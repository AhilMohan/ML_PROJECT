**PROJECT NAME:** Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning in Python
**ABSTRACT:** 
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and customers alike, leading to substantial financial losses annually. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to keep pace with the evolving tactics of fraudsters. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to develop an effective fraud detection system. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset containing transactional information, including features such as transaction amount, location, time, and customer demographics, we aim to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions.
